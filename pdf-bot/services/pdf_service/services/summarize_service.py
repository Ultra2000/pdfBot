Processing Status: Placeholder (actual AI summarization not available)

SUMMARY:
This is a placeholder summary for testing purposes. In a full implementation,
this would contain an AI-generated summary of the PDF content using advanced
natural language processing models.

The summary would be tailored to the requested length ({length}) and would
capture the key points, main arguments, and important details from the
original document.

Key features that would be included:
- Extractive and abstractive summarization techniques
- Content understanding and topic identification
- Language-specific processing for {language}
- Customizable summary length and focus areas

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Text extraction using pdfminer.six
- NLP processing with transformers or OpenAI API
- Multi-language support for summaries
- Quality scoring and relevance ranking

---
Note: To enable full summarization functionality, integrate with:
- OpenAI GPT API for high-quality summaries
- Hugging Face transformers for local processing
- Google Cloud Natural Language API
- Or similar NLP services
